## Internship Reports:
### 1. Understand the mechanisms by which birds are producing vocalizations, with Pauline Provini at CRI
By following this [link](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page) you will find the page associated with my 5 months internship with Pauline Provini at [CRI](https://www.cri-paris.org/en) (Centre de Recherche Interdsiciplinaire) where I looked at the influence of the phylogeny, size and nocturnality on acoustic parameters of bird's song, in the context of a [morphofunctional study of birds vocal system](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/tY6OqgWS/summary). You will find there my [Internship report](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/DELAMARE_Irina_internship_report.pdf), a pdf version of my [presentation](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/Intership%20presentation%20L3%20-%20Irina%20Delamare.pdf), and the [programming](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/tree/master/CodeR) part of this internship where I  gathered and analysed birds' recordings. 
Following this internship, I gave a talk at [SICB 2021](http://burkclients.com/sicb/meetings/2021/site/index.html) international conference cycle. You can find my talk [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc85poM5rC0), (sorry for the quality).
You can also have access to the weekly blog I kept during the internsip following [this](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/vXCBp29N/summary) link.

Prior to this internship I worked 3 weeks with a pear on a project proposed by Pauline Provini, creating the foundations for my internship. You can find the work we did (programs, research and blogs) [here](https://github.com/irinade/Fellows_Project).

### 2. Study of the cerebellum development in snakes, with Richard Wingate at Kings' College London
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Intership-Report-at-King-s-College-London/blob/master/Internship%20Report%20Irina%20Delamare%20at%20KCL%20_%20Study%20of%20cerebellum%20development%20in%20snakes.pdf) you will find my report of the intership I made on summer 2019 at King's College London in the Developmental Neurobiology Department. My supervisor was Dr. Wingate. I studied snakes cerebellum, and their Purkinje cells ordering. I followed 3 different kinds of staining protocols : Nissl stain, Immunohistochemistry, and Golgi stain. 


## Dissertation Reviews:
### 1. Principles of animal forms and functions
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Principles-of-animal-forms-and-functions/blob/master/Filled%20Plan.pdf) you will find a biology chapter 2 classmates of mine and myself wrote for an assignment in biology class on "Principles of animal forms and functions". This pdf version is not optimal as our work was meant to be for an interactive website where multiple chapters (the one written by other teams in my class) where easily accesible. Sadly, the website was disolved after our assignement. 

### 2. A little guide to COVID-19
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Coronavirus_a_little_guide/blob/master/Partiel%20Bio%202020%20Irina%20Delamare.pdf) is a work I did during the first French lockdown for my biology class. The assignement was to write an article in the continuity of the biology chapter written earlier in the year (Principles of animal forms and functions) and in realtion with the world cituation at that time (so in relation with either COVID-19 or the lockdown).

### 3. Aquathon: Water quality in Brest
You can find [here](https://github.com/irinade/AQUATHON-REPORT-Water-qualities-in-Brest/blob/master/AQUATHON%20REPORT%20_%20Water%20qualities%20in%20Brest%20.pdf) my contribution to a 2 weeks Aquathon project organised by the CRI where my team and I tested the water quality in Brest to determine the well-being of the marine ecosystem.

### 4. The unfulfilled promises of Transgenic Monkey
[This](https://github.com/irinade/The-unfulfilled-promises-of-Transgenic-Monkey/blob/master/Projet%20de%20recherche%20individuel%20(AJA)%20de%20Irina%20DELAMARE%20_%20The%20unfulfilled%20promises%20of%20Transgenic%20Monkey.pdf) is a quick review of the socio-cultural impact of the generation of genetically engineered monkey model of human diseases.
This work describe the reasons given to justify the experiments made on monkeys. It focus on the teams working on this research subject, who finances them, in which country they are located, what are there plan in the near future, etc … This review also look at the legal status of non-human primates and apes, and the jurisdiction and control of their use for scientific purpose. It also introduce some major controversies and the ethical issues to use monkeys in experiments.

### 5. Practical Work Thesis: Immunology and Genetics
[This](https://github.com/irinade/Practical-Work-Thesis-Immunology-and-Genetics/blob/master/Thesis%20%20Imunology%20and%20Genetics.pdf) is a recap of a 1 week laboratory work on an autoimmune disease I did during my first year. This work is about quantitative genetics and explain the localization of a gene using positional cloning. It is a study of a human autoimmune pathology using rats as an experimental model. It was written in collaboration with one of my classmate.

### 6. Interaction between visitors and animals in a zoo 
[This](https://github.com/irinade/Compte-rendu-de-la-sortie-la-M-nagerie-du-Jardin-des-Plantes/blob/master/Compte-rendu%20Jardin%20des%20Plantes.pdf) is the study of the interaction between visitors and animals in La Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes zoo for a Human's and Social's Sciences courses. (written in french!!)
It was made in collaboration with two classmates.


## Computing experiences:
### 1. Reanalizing data and learning about reproductibility, in R
This 3 weeks project intended to give student an idea of the importance of reproductibility in science by making groups of 4 students reanalyse data from a published paper. [Here](https://github.com/irinade/AJA_Project) you will find the GitHub page with the program I wrote in collaboration with 3 other classmates in R language. I am not allowed to share our results, analysis, and the files needed to run the program (sorry) as it is not my intelectual propriety. But you can still find the programming I worked on where we rearanged the data, made statistical analysis and use linear regressions.
We used multiples library including tidyverse and ggplot2.

### 2. Impact of Bison reintroduction in Siberia, in Python
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia) is a simulation 2 classmates and I created during a 1 week project in python programing language. Our worked foccus of finding the optimal density of American bison to reintroduce in Siberia to slow down the thawing of the permafrost by trampling of the snow.
The assignment was to find an application to create and use differential equations and define a relationship between a physical quantity (the functions, here the density of bisons to reintroduce) and their rates of change (the derivatives, here the thawing of the permafrost). We also made a [poster](https://github.com/irinade/Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia/blob/master/Impact%20of%20Bison%20reintroduction%20in%20Siberia.pdf) to present our work and a [paper](https://github.com/irinade/Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia/blob/master/Rapport%20final.pdf) summing up our findings.
We used multiples library including matplotlib and numpy in order to use differential equations and plot our results.

### 3. Understand the mechanisms by which birds are producing vocalizations, with Pauline Provini at CRI, in R
During this [internship](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/tree/master/CodeR) I worked in Rstudio to gather sound from the web, extract data from those sounds (like the amplitude and frequency), analyse those data and make principal componenent analysis to compare those data to other variables such as birds' phylogeny, birds' size, and birds' nocturnality. 
I used multiples library such as soundgen, tuneR, here, dplyr, ggbiplot, ggtree, or phytools. 

### 4. Rosalind exercises, in Python
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Rosalind) and [here](https://github.com/irinade/Python_BioInfo_ProjectS) are my try at begining tackling [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) programing problems either for my informatic class in L1 or just for the fun.
 
### 5. Prime number calculator, in Python
[These](https://github.com/irinade/Prime-number-calculator) are 3 prime numbers calculators that I pgrogramed that will print a list of every prime number from 2 to a maximum value that you input. Each of this program brings a new and inovative way to resolve the problem!
Prime-number-calculator_1 iterates a list of non-primes numbers, a list of all numbers from 2 to a maximum value that you input, and it creates a list of prime numbers by doing the difference between the first two lists.
Prime-number-calculator_2 define a function that tells if a given number is a prime number. Then it creates a list of all prime numbers in a range of 2 to a maximum value that you input, defining with the function if each number is prime or not.
Prime-number-calculator_3 iterates a list of primes numbers starting by 2, and divide any numbers by this list. It also uses the time function to have an estimation of how quick the program is.
