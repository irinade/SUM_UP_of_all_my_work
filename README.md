# SUM UP of my work and expeiences
Here you will be able to find a sum up of all my work, grouped by internship reports, dissertation reviews, and computing experiencies !
Enjoy!!

## Internship Reports:
### 1. Understand the mechanisms by which birds are producing vocalizations, with Pauline Provini at CRI
By following this [link](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page) you will find the page associated with my 5 months internship with Pauline Provini at [CRI](https://www.cri-paris.org/en) (Centre de Recherche Interdsiciplinaire) where I looked at the influence of the phylogeny, size and nocturnality on acoustic parameters of bird's song, in the context of a [morphofunctional study of birds vocal system](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/tY6OqgWS/summary). You will find there my [Internship report](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/DELAMARE_Irina_internship_report.pdf), a pdf version of my [presentation](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/Intership%20presentation%20L3%20-%20Irina%20Delamare.pdf), and the [programming](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/tree/master/CodeR) part of this internship where I  gathered and analysed birds' recordings. 
Following this internship, I gave a talk at [SICB 2021](http://burkclients.com/sicb/meetings/2021/site/index.html) international conference cycle. You can find my talk [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc85poM5rC0), (sorry for the quality).
You can also have access to the weekly blog I kept during the internsip following [this](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/vXCBp29N/summary) link.

Prior to this internship I worked 3 weeks with a pear on a project proposed by Pauline Provini, creating the foundations for my internship. You can find the work we did (programs, research and blogs) [here](https://github.com/irinade/Fellows_Project).

## Dissertation Reviews:
### 1. Principles of animal forms and functions
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Principles-of-animal-forms-and-functions/blob/master/Filled%20Plan.pdf) you will find a biology chapter 2 classmates of mine and myself wrote for an assignment in biology class on "Principles of animal forms and functions". This pdf version is not optimal as our work was meant to be for an interactive website where multiple chapters (the one written by other teams in my class) where easily accesible. Sadly, the website was disolved after our assignement. 

### 2. A little guide to COVID-19
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Coronavirus_a_little_guide/blob/master/Partiel%20Bio%202020%20Irina%20Delamare.pdf) is a work I did during the first French lockdown for my biology class. The assignement was to write an article in the continuity of the biology chapter written earlier in the year (Principles of animal forms and functions) and in realtion with the world cituation at that time (so in relation with either COVID-19 or the lockdown).


## Computing experiences:
### 1. Reanalizing data and learning about reproductibility
This 3 weeks project intended to give student an idea of the importance of reproductibility in science by making groups of 4 students reanalyse data from a published paper. [Here](https://github.com/irinade/AJA_Project) you will find the GitHub page with the program I wrote in collaboration with 3 other classmates. I am not allowed to share our results and analysis, and the files needed to run the program (sorry) as I am not allowed to share it publicly (not my intelectual propriety). But yoou can still find the programming I worked on.

### 2. Impact of Bison reintroduction in Siberia
[Here](https://github.com/irinade/Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia) is a simulation 2 classmates and I created during a 1 week project. Our worked foccus of finding the optimal density of American bison to reintroduce in Siberia to slow down the thawing of the permafrost by trampling of the snow.
The assignment was to find an application to create and use differential equations and define a relationship between a physical quantity (the functions, here the density of bisons to reintroduce) and their rates of change (the derivatives, here the thawing of the permafrost).
