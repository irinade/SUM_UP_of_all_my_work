## Internship Reports:
### 1. Understand the mechanisms by which birds are producing vocalizations, with Pauline Provini at CRI
By following this [link](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page) you will find the page associated with my 5 months internship with Pauline Provini at [CRI](https://www.cri-paris.org/en) (Centre de Recherche Interdsiciplinaire) where I looked at the influence of the phylogeny, size and nocturnality on acoustic parameters of bird's song, in the context of a [morphofunctional study of birds vocal system](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/tY6OqgWS/summary). You will find there my [Internship report](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/DELAMARE_Irina_internship_report.pdf), a pdf version of my [presentation](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/blob/master/Intership%20presentation%20L3%20-%20Irina%20Delamare.pdf), and the [programming](https://github.com/irinade/Internship_Report_L3_Understand-the-mechanisms-by-which-birds-produce-vocalizations_GitHub_page/tree/master/CodeR) part of this internship where I  gathered and analysed birds' recordings. 
Following this internship, I gave a talk at [SICB 2021](http://burkclients.com/sicb/meetings/2021/site/index.html) international conference cycle. You can find my talk [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc85poM5rC0), (sorry for the quality).
You can also have access to the weekly blog I kept during the internsip following [this](https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/vXCBp29N/summary) link.
